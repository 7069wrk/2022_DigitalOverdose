congrats!!!! good job.

Now you should answer some EZ questions. It's about computer parts . It can help you to learn something, or if you already know, you can easily pass this section!

The zip file password is the answer to one of these questions:

1. Which component on the Motherboard generates the most heat? (hint:three letters).
2. What is the name of the fastest cache on the motherboard?
3. What is the maximum amount of DRAM that a 32-bit system can support?
4. The LGP CPU is mostly used by which company? (Hint: there are two companies that build CPUs; one of them is the answer!)

Four simple questions. :)

But u should know that this is not the last task.....

I will give u some hint, inside the zip file there is a sound track and a photo get the code from the audio file and get access to the file inside the photo.. 

Ik u are saying where tf is the zip file??
Its on my Github repository waiting for you.(hint : ARROW#5141)
